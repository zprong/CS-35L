1. man -k <word>

2. $ whereis cp 
   cp is located in usr/local/cs/bin/cp
   $ whereis wc
   wc is located in /usr/local/cs/bin/wc

3. $ find /usr/bin -name "?"
   We then find executables X, w, and [.
   Then using the man-pages and the help shell-command, we find the followin	g:
   w - shows who is logged on and what they are doing
   [ - evaluates a conditional expression
   X - There is no manpage for X

4. Putting /usr/bin/emacs into the command line takes you to GNU Emacs,
which is a subset of the GNU OS

5. using g+s grants permission for the group to run an executable
with permissions and privileges of the group
   using o-x removes the privilege of those of the "other" group
   to execute a file.
   
6. the -ctime -n option lets you search for files changed in the last n
days. Therefore if you replace n with 21, you can check for files modified
in the last three weeks

7. Using $ manpage find
   and typing /type, we find that find -d will look for directories.
   So we type $ / -type d -ctime -21 in our command line

8. $ whereis find
   $ cd /usr/bin
   $ ls -l -H
   The answer should be found on the very top of the output. 

9. $ ls /usr/lib -lt
   The oldest file is libgpg-error.so.0.10.0  dated back to Jan 26 2014

10. $ man locale
    This tells us that locale gets its data from the environment variables

11. Going into emacs, we use the keystroke C-h a and enter "sort" and
find that it lists these commands:
    buffer-menu-sort
    sort-columns
    sort-fields
    sort-lines
    sort-numeric-fields
    sort-pages
    sort-paragraphs
    sort-regexp-fields
    tabulated-list-col-sort
    tabulated-list-sort

12. We find this data by scrolling through the key-bindings menu
through C-H-b
    C-M-a: beginning-of-defun: Moves cursor back to beginning of
    the function
    C-M-b: backward-sexp: Moves cursor to beginning of s-expression
    C-M-c: exit-recursive-edit: Exits recursively
    C-M-d: down-list: Moves into inner paranthesis
    C-M-e: end-of-defun: Moves cursor to end of the function
    C-M-f: forward-sexp: Moves cursor to end of s-expression
    C-M-h: mark-defun: Marks a function

13. Through the same process, we found what C-g does.
    C-g is keystroke for keyboard-quit.
    But then we use C-h v and enter C-g to find a more detailed
    definition for it.
    This signals a 'quit' condition and is an interactive compiled Lisp
    function.
    Thus during execution of Lisp code, doing this would cause a direct
    quit. 

14. Using C-h f and then entering yank, we find the following:
    Emacs' yank function is basically a "paste" function of whatever
    text was most recently killed.

15. Using emacs, we used the keystroke C-x d in order to use the dired
command.
The only difference is that emacs' dired command also states how many are
available in the directory rather than only how many are used.
