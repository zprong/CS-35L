We start by setting up our BeagleBone by
1) Connecting it to our computer via USB
2) We then found the "BeagleBone Getting Started" drive
3) Installed the necessary drivers
4) Checked the "START.htm" file to see if our drivers were all installed
5) SSH-ed into BeagleBone
   - hostname: 192.168.7.2
6) Then we did the following commands
$  sudo connmanctl
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services
connmanctl> agent on
connmanctl> wifi_2cf7f106539a_55434c415f5745425f524553_managed_n
connmanctl> quit

7) Then we find the IP address
$ ifconfig
inet addr:169.232.127.105  Bcast:169.232.127.255  Mask:255.255.255.
inet6 addr: fe80::2ef7:f1ff:fe06:539a/64 Scope:Link

8) Now we update the database of apt-get & install xauth tool for X11
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install xauth
#install firefox
$ apt-get install firefox-esr-110n-en-gb
