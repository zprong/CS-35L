We start by setting up our BeagleBone by
1) Connecting it to our computer via USB
2) We then found the "BeagleBone Getting Started" drive
3) Installed the necessary drivers
4) Checked the "START.htm" file to see if our drivers were all installed
5) SSH-ed into BeagleBone
   - hostname: 192.168.7.2
   - login as: root
6) Then we did the following commands
$  sudo connmanctl
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services
connmanctl> agent on
connmanctl> wifi_2cf7f106539a_5a616368e2809973206950686f6e65_managed_psk
connmanctl> quit

7) Then we find the IP address
$ ifconfig
inet addr:172.20.10.4
where inet addr is our IP address

8) Now we update the database of apt-get & install xauth tool for X11
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install xauth
#install firefox
$ apt-get install firefox-esr-110n-en-gb

We check to see if we have openssh-server and openssh-client installed
$ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

Then we generate our public and private keys
$ ssh-keygen
and save it to /root/.ssh/is_rsa and id_resa with no password
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
Output:
The key fingerprint is:
79:19:ab:6d:70:2a:a3:4f:bd:64:a9:03:57:c5:2c:dc root@904765400.lasr.cs.ucla.edu
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|       . +       |
|        o E      |
|         o.      |

Create an account for client on the server:
$ sudo useradd -d /home/name -m zach
$ sudo passwd zach
Enter new UNIX password: lol

Create .ssh directory for new user
$ cd /home/name
$ mkdir .ssh

Change ownership and permission on .ssh directory
$ sudo chown -R zach .ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Then my partner accesses my server
# Copy public key to server 
$ ssh-copy-id -i zach@172.20.10.4
# Adds private key to ssh-agent so that he can login again without typing
  any passwords/phrases
$ ssh-add

My partner got into my server with the following commands
ssh zach@172.20.10.4

and he made a file
$ touch me.txt
